# WixiLite: Frontend JS Developer test asignment for MailerLite

## Challenges

- How to allow responsiveness / configuring elements position?

My first thoughts were between allowing to configure almost all CSS properties, for both containers and elements, and fixing the total page sizes, one for desktop and another for mobile, allowing to drag everywhere and just fix it in those coordinates.

I decided to go with the second option, because it's easier to understand for non-technical users and makes more sense with the asignment guidelines. Although the project architecture is ready to allow the first option too.
